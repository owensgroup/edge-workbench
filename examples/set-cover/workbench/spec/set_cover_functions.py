"""The user-defined operators Algorithm X names, registered for the evaluator.

The IR carries operator names only; a FunctionRegistry gives them meaning.
The default registry already defines everything this cascade uses -- including
``select-max-val`` and ``select-min-val`` for the two populates, ``floor`` for
the depth extraction, and ``ANY`` and ``update`` -- except one.

``take_left_if_less``: E04's operator
-------------------------------------
The tutorial writes the path truncation as::

    TPath_{i,r} = Path_{i,r} . d*_i :: /\\ <(^)

and the bare ``<`` is ambiguous in a way that matters. The registry's ``lt``
returns a BOOLEAN, which would make TPath a mask. But TPath is fed straight
into E06's partial update to form ``Path_{i+1}``, whose entries are DEPTHS,
and the tutorial's own worked example settles it: at i = 2 the path is
{R3:1, R2:2} with d* = 2, and Path_3 is {R3:1, R0:2}. The surviving entry kept
its depth of 1. It did not become True.

So the operator is a FILTERED take_left: the left value where it is less than
the right, absent otherwise.

WHY IT IS NOT REGISTERED AS AN ALIAS OF `lt`, AND NOT NAMED `lt`
----------------------------------------------------------------
Because it is not ``lt``, and calling it ``lt`` would make the artifact claim
the tutorial says something it does not. The workbench's operator-comparison
gate reads the surface ``einsum.edge`` and the IR side by side and reports any
operator that differs -- that gate exists because a silently substituted merge
operator once passed every other check. Emitting a distinct name here means
the gate reports this divergence, and it should keep reporting it until the
tutorial's author says which reading is intended.

A filtered take_left may well deserve to be a builtin; three of the
comparisons would have the same shape. That is a question for the registry,
not something to settle inside one algorithm's function file.

Import note: ``edge_ir.evaluator`` must be imported before ``edge_ir.udf``.
The reverse order hits a circular import.

    HOW A COMPUTE OPERATOR SAYS "NOTHING HERE"
    ------------------------------------------
    By returning the OUTPUT TENSOR'S EMPTY VALUE, which `ctx.output_empty`
    supplies. A compute operator's return is stored as the value at that
    point; there is no separate absence channel, and the empty-is-absent rule
    is what turns a value into no-entry.

    Returning None instead does not mean absent -- it stores None, which then
    reaches the next operator as an operand and raises there rather than here.
    That is how this was first written, and E07's `ge` is where it surfaced,
    two Einsums downstream of the mistake.

    Reading the empty value from the context rather than writing -1 is what
    keeps this operator usable on a tensor whose empty value is something
    else.
